Actors overview Actors are serverless cloud programs that can perform anything from a simple action, like filling out a web form, to a complex operation, like crawling an entire website or removing duplicates from a large dataset. Because Actors can persist their state and be restarted, their runs can be as short or as long as necessary, from seconds to hours, or even indefinitely. Basically, Actors are programs packaged as Docker images, which accept a well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce a well-defined JSON output. Additional contextFor more context, read the Actor whitepaper. Actor components Actors consist of these elements: Dockerfile which specifies where the Actor's source code is, how to build it, and run it. Documentation in a form of a README.md file. Input and output schemas that describe what input the Actor requires, and what results it produces. Access to an out-of-the-box storage system for Actor data, results, and files. Metadata such as the Actor name, description, author, and version. The documentation and input/output schemas help people understand what the Actor does, enter required inputs in the user interface or API, and integrate results into other workflows. Actors can call and interact with each other to build more complex systems from simple ones. Build Actors Build Actors to automate tasks, scrape data, or create custom workflows. The Apify platform gives you everything you need to develop, test, and deploy your code. Ready to start? Check out the Actor development documentation. Running Actors You can run Actors manually in Apify Console, using the API, CLI, or scheduler. You can easily integrate Actors with other apps, share them with other people, publish them in Apify Store, and even monetize. Try ActorsTo get a better idea of what Apify Actors are, visit Apify Store and try out some of them! Public and private Actors Actors can be public or private. Private Actors are yours to use and keep; no one will see them if you don't want them to. Public Actors are available to everyone in Apify Store. You can make them free to use, or you can charge for them.Actors overviewActor componentsBuild ActorsRunning ActorsPublic and private Actors"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Explain: Running Actors"},{"role":"assistant","content":"On this pageRunning ActorsCopy for LLMIn this section, you learn how to run Apify Actors using Apify Console or programmatically. You will learn about their configuration, versioning, data retention, usage, and pricing. Run your first Apify Actor Before you can run an Actor, you have to either choose one of the existing ones from Apify Store or build your own. To get started, we recommend trying out an Actor from the Store. Once you have chosen an Actor, you can start it in a number of ways. You will need an Apify account to complete this tutorial. If you don't have one, complete the sign-up process first. Don't worry about the price - it's free. 1. Choose your Actor After you sign-in to Apify Console, navigate to Apify Store. We'll pick the Website Content Crawler: 2. Configure it On the Actor's page, head over to the Input tab. Don't be put off by all the boxes - the Actor is pre-configured to run without any extra input. Just click the Start button in the bottom-left corner. Alternatively, you can play around with the settings to make the results more interesting for you. 3. Wait for the results The Actor might take a while to gather its first results and finish its run. Meanwhile, let's take some time to explore the platform options: Note the other tabs, which provide you with information about the Actor run. For example, you can access the run Log and Storage. At the top right, you can click on the API button to explore the related API endpoints 4. Get the results Shortly you will see the first results popping up: And you can use the export button at the bottom left to export the data in multiple formats: And that's it! Now you can get back to the Actor's input, play with it, and try out more of the Apify Actors or build your own. Running via Apify API Actors can also be invoked using the Apify API by sending an HTTP POST request to the Run Actor endpoint, such as: https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/compass~crawler-google-places/runs?token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN> An Actor's input and its content type can be passed as a payload of the POST request, and additional options can be specified using URL query parameters. For more details, see the Run Actor section in the API reference. To learn more about this, read the Run an Actor or task and retrieve data via API tutorial. Running programmatically Actors can also be invoked programmatically from your own applications or from other Actors. To start an Actor from your own application, we recommend using our API client libraries for JavaScript or Python. JavaScriptPythonimport { ApifyClient } from 'apify-client';const client = new ApifyClient({ token: 'MY-API-TOKEN',});// Start the Google Maps Scraper Actor and wait for it to finish.const actorRun = await client.actor('compass/crawler-google-places').call({ queries: 'apify',});// Fetch scraped results from the Actor's dataset.const { items } = await client.dataset(actorRun.defaultDatasetId).listItems();console.dir(items);from apify_client import ApifyClientapify_client = ApifyClient('MY-API-TOKEN')# Start the Google Maps Scraper Actor and wait for it to finish.actor_run = apify_client.actor('compass/crawler-google-places').call( run_input={ 'queries': 'apify' })# Fetch scraped results from the Actor's dataset.dataset_items = apify_client.dataset(actor_run['defaultDatasetId']).list_items().itemsprint(dataset_items) The newly started Actor runs under the account associated with the provided token, and therefore all resources consumed are charged to this user account. Internally, the call() function invokes the Run Actor API endpoint, waits for the Actor to finish, and reads its output using the Get dataset items API endpoint.Run your first Apify Actor1.
